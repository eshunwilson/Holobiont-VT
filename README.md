## Vertical Transmission Modeling with Python

### Description:
Welcome to our repository dedicated to Python-based modeling for vertical transmission. Our goal is to develop robust Python code that simulates and models vertical transmission phenomena across various domains. 
This repository provides an open platform for collaboration and development in this critical area.

### Features and Objectives:

- Develop Python algorithms and models to simulate vertical transmission processes.
- Explore and analyze various scenarios related to vertical transmission within different contexts (e.g., epidemiology, genetics, technology networks).
- Provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials for users to understand, utilize, and contribute to the models effectively.
- Foster collaboration and contributions from the community to enhance the accuracy and versatility of the models.

### Contributing:
We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in modeling vertical transmission using Python. Whether you're interested in coding, testing, documentation, or providing feedback, your involvement is valuable. 
Please refer to our contributing guidelines for more information on how to get started.

### Getting Started:
To begin exploring our models or contribute to the project, check out our installation guide and documentation in the 'docs' folder (2BA). 
We encourage you to fork this repository, make your contributions, and submit pull requests for review.

### Community and Support:
We value a diverse and inclusive community. Feel free to reach out through issues, discussions, or email if you have any questions, suggestions, or need support. 
Let's collaborate to advance our understanding of vertical transmission through Python modeling.


### Acknowledgments:
We express our gratitude members of GLOBE at Copenhagen University and Dr. Joan Roughgarden from Stanford on their support and insight on this project.

Join us in exploring the dynamics of vertical transmission through modeling and simulations.
